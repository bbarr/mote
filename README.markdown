# Mote
Mote aims to be a simple light weight Mongo DB abstraction layer built on top of the Ruby driver.  Mote aims to delegate as much as possible to the Ruby driver, aiming to only help provide convenience to DRY up code.  Some of the implementation has been borrowed from [MongoMatic's](https://github.com/benmyles/mongomatic) approach.
